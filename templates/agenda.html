    <h2>Leading through change: Profit, People and Planet</h2>
    <p>Today, 'Corporate Responsibility' is not just a catchphrase. The globalisation of markets, investment and media is rapidly ushering businesses into a new 'Age of Accountability'. In this age, good governance not only calls for greater transparency and disclosure but also demands engagement with stakeholders and the larger community. In this context, corporations will need to report several non-financial measures of performance and responsibilty. One of the ways to achieve this is by triple bottom line accounting. Business leaders will soon have to learn to integrate this concept into their business strategy. It will be this shift in mindset and the ability to build relationships with the community that will determine the 'effectiveness' of a leader. Keeping this thought in mind, the summit will delve deeper into the 'People' part of triple-bottom line responsibilty by addressing the topic: "Managing Millenials -- The Dynamism of an Emerging Workforce". Tattva Bodha envisions a world where businesses have healthy profits and are equally responsible towards People and our Planet. </p>

    <h2>Leaders Roundtable:</h2>
    <p>Times are changing. Corporation's impact on the larger society and the environment in addtion to financial growth, as captured by the pithy and alliterative 'Profits, People and Planet' is fast becoming the norm of the day. The private sector will gradually begin to report business performance in terms of 'people, planet and profits' either due to enlightened self-interest and/or the activism of non-business stakeholder groups- such as environmentalists, comminity organisers and advocates of social justice. Business leaders will increasingly face the challenge od relating to activists and to international agreements (such as the Kyoto protocol) as business partners and not as adversaries. The approach adopted to meet this challenge is what will determine the leaders of tomorrow.</p>

    <h2>HR Confluence: "Managing the Millennials -- The Dynamism of the Emerging Workforce"</h2>
    <p>Today's workforce -- dubbed 'the millenials' -- is poised to challenge the workplace like no other. This generation communicates differently, has ambitious aspirations, is technology savvy, non-hierarchical and wants a voice in decision-making. Therefore generational diversity and inclusion becomes as much an issue as that of gender, race and equal opportunity. The immense potential of this dynamic, emerging workforce when understood, shaped and unleashed will enable corporations to deliver holistic and superior results.</p>
